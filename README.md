Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the growth of registered users across various districts in Maharashtra from 2018 to 2024. Utilizing Python's data processing libraries and visualization tools, we've implemented a series of data-driven analyses and visualizations to uncover trends and insights into user registration patterns over time.

Features
Data Extraction and Processing: Extracted data from JSON files representing district-wise user registrations for each year.
Visualization Techniques: Implemented diverse visualization techniques including pie charts, line graphs, bar charts, stacked bar charts, sunburst charts, and radar charts to effectively communicate data insights.
Customized Data Handling: Developed custom data handling scripts to aggregate and summarize registration data, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
Interactive Visualizations: Used Matplotlib for visualizations, ensuring clarity and interactivity in presenting growth trends across districts.
Error Handling and Optimization: Implemented robust error handling and optimized data processing pipelines to manage large datasets efficiently.

Technologies Used -

Python: Core programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Matplotlib: Primary library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
JSON: Data format used for storing and exchanging data.
GitHub: Version control and collaboration platform for project management and code sharing.
Project Structure
Main Folder: Contains sub-folders for each year (2018 to 2024).
Yearly Sub-folders: Each contains JSON files (1.json to 4.json) with district-wise user registration data.
Scripts: Python scripts for data extraction, processing, and visualization.

Future Improvements
Incorporate advanced statistical analysis techniques.
Develop a web-based dashboard for interactive data exploration.
Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics.
