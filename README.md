# PayPulse
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the growth of registered users across various districts in Maharashtra from 2018 to 2024. Utilizing Python's data processing libraries and visualization tools, we've implemented a series of data-driven analyses and visualizations to uncover trends and insights into user registration patterns over time.

Features
Data Extraction and Processing: Extracted data from JSON files representing district-wise user registrations for each year.
Visualization Techniques: Implemented diverse visualization techniques including pie charts, line graphs, bar charts, stacked bar charts, sunburst charts, and radar charts to effectively communicate data insights.
Customized Data Handling: Developed custom data handling scripts to aggregate and summarize registration data, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
Interactive Visualizations: Used Matplotlib for visualizations, ensuring clarity and interactivity in presenting growth trends across districts.
Error Handling and Optimization: Implemented robust error handling and optimized data processing pipelines to manage large datasets efficiently.
